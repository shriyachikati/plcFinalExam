# PLC Final Exam

## 10. Syntactically valid assignment statements with atleast 7 tokens:
```txt
int a = b + 2 - c;
```
The above assignment statement passes the semantic rules. 

```txt
int s, t;
int u = s + true;
```
The above assignment statement fails the semantic rules because a type 'boolean' cannot be assigned to the type 'int'.

```txt
String plc = "Final" + "Exam";
```
The above assignment statement passes the semantic rules.
