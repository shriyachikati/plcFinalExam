# PLC Final Exam

## 10. Syntactically valid assignment statements with atleast 7 tokens:
```txt
int a = b + 2 - c;
```
The above assignment statement passes the semantic rules. 



```txt
int s, t;
String v = s + t * 2;
```
The above assignment statement fails the semantic rules because, type 'int' is being assigned to a variable with type 'String'.



```txt
String plc = "Final" + "Exam";
```
The above assignment statement passes the semantic rules.
